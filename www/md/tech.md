## Tech used in this app 

**CovidShiny** is an interactive web portal that provides multiple analysis modules to visualize and explore mutations among SARS-CoV-2 large-sized samples and help users to pre-evaluate RT-PCR assay efficiency based on updated SARS-CoV-2 global mutations. 

**CovidShiny** is easy-to-use and users can download figures and tables in all available formats. It may take some time to load some figures like global SNP&protein profile which takes more time to compute. We believe that **CovidShiny** could be used more widely in studing other virus in the future.

The portal is built entirely in **R** and **Shiny** using the **RStudio** development environment.

+ The whole app is powererd by [`{shiny}`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).
+ Data visualisation is mainly done with [`{ggplot2}`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), {[`ggpubr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggpubr/versions/0.1.4)} and {[`ggsci`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsci/index.html)}
