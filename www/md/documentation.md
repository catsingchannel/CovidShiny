## **CovidShiny: SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic analysis**

## About this app

The current release of CovidShiny contains 58162 SARS-CoV-2 samples and we will continue to update the sequence data for monitoring the virus mutation trend.

## Analysis Modules

We here present 6 modules to track the SARS-CoV-2 mutations:

#### **Mutation statistics**

This module provides an overview of SARS-CoV-2 mutation features and displays mutation statistics in terms of geographical distribution, mutation hotspots, etc.

#### **SNP&Protein profile**

This module displays SNPs and proteins mutation profile in SARS-CoV-2 whole genome as heatmap or counts figure.

#### **Assay profile**

This module implements the functionality to perform user-specified RT-PCR assay evaluation and comparison.

#### **Last five nucleotides of primers**

This module provides the functionality to calculate the mutation ratio in SARS-CoV-2 genomic binding sites of last five nucleotides of RT-PCR primers.

#### **Double assay evaluation**

This module allows user to submit RT-PCR assay list in .csv format to choose a pair of assays to evaluate the coverage of double assay in all SARS-CoV-2 samples.

#### **Co-mutation analysis**

This module allows user to speculate whether some variants evolved separately or derived from other variants (e.g., S:D614G accompanied by some 'passenger' mutations).
